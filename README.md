## Overview

The \$MSTY Portfolio Simulator helps you model the long-term growth of a portfolio invested in \$MSTY, accounting for regular dividend payments, dividend reinvestment (DRIP), taxes, loan financing scenarios, and supplemental contributions like dollar-cost averaging (DCA) and recurring salary investments. This tool is perfect for visualizing how your investment might grow over time, especially when leveraging loans to increase your initial position.

## What This Tool Can Help You With

- Calculate potential returns from \$MSTY investments over time
- Model how loans can be used to enhance your initial position
- Visualize the effect of dividend reinvestment (DRIP)
- Account for taxes on dividend income
- See when a loan would be paid off and how your net portfolio value grows
- Model supplemental contributions like dollar-cost averaging and salary investments
- Compare different DRIP strategies (percentage-based or fixed amount)
- Understand how different parameters affect your investment outcomes

## Inputs Explained

The simulator allows you to customize various parameters:

### Investment Parameters

- **Initial Share Count**: Number of \$MSTY shares you already own (not purchased with the loan)
- **Initial Investment**: Dollar amount you're investing now (will be used to purchase shares at the Initial Share Price)
- **Initial Share Price**: Current price per share of \$MSTY
- **Dividend Yield per 4w (%)**: The percentage yield for each 4-week dividend period
- **Monthly Appreciation (%)**: Expected monthly share price change (can be negative for a conservative model)
- **Simulation Start Month**: The month of the year to start the simulation (1-12 for Jan-Dec)

### DRIP Strategy

- **DRIP Strategy**: Choose how dividend reinvestment is handled:
  - *Percentage*: Reinvest a percentage of dividends
  - *Fixed Amount*: Reinvest a fixed dollar amount each period
- **DRIP Percentage**: Percentage of dividends to reinvest when using percentage strategy
- **DRIP Fixed Amount**: Dollar amount to reinvest when using fixed amount strategy
- **Fixed Income**: Dollar amount of fixed income to receive regardless of DRIP strategy

### Loan Parameters

- **Loan Amount**: Size of loan used to purchase additional shares
- **Annual Interest Rate (%)**: The loan's annual interest rate
- **Amortization Months**: Total number of months to pay off the loan
- **Surplus for DRIP to Principal (%)**: Percentage of dividend income (after taxes) that goes to paying down loan principal rather than purchasing more shares

### Tax Withholding Parameters

- **Withholding Strategy**: Choose between no withholding, monthly withholding, or quarterly withholding
- **Withholding Method**: Select how tax amounts are calculated:
  - *Tax Bracket Based*: Calculates taxes based on your income tax bracket
  - *Fixed Amount*: Withholds a specific dollar amount each period
  - *Fixed Percentage*: Withholds a fixed percentage of dividend income
- **Tax Filing Type**: Filing status (single, married filing jointly, etc.) for tax bracket calculations
- **Base Income**: Your annual income (used for tax bracket calculations)
- **Fixed Amount**: Dollar amount withheld per period when using the fixed amount method
- **Fixed Percentage**: Percentage of dividends withheld when using the fixed percentage method

### Supplemental Contributions

- **Add Contribution**: Add supplemental contributions to your portfolio over time
- **Types of Contributions**:
  - *Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA)*: Regular fixed-amount investments at specified intervals
  - *Salary Contribution*: Regular contributions from salary at standard pay periods
  - *One-Time Contribution*: Single lump-sum addition to your portfolio
- **Frequency Options**: Daily, weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly depending on type
- **Date Range**: Set full simulation period or custom date range for each contribution
- **Toggle Contributions**: Enable/disable individual contributions without deleting them

## How to Use the Simulator

2. **Enter Your Parameters**: Fill out the form with your investment details and assumptions
3. **Add Supplemental Contributions**: Click "Add Contribution" to set up DCA, salary, or one-time contributions
4. **Calculate**: Click the "Calculate" button to run the simulation
5. **View Results**: The results section will display:
   - A summary of key metrics
   - Charts showing portfolio growth over time
   - Detailed tables showing year-by-year and month-by-month data

## Running the Application Locally

To run the simulator on your own computer:

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (version 18 or higher)
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/davidpeden3/portfolio-sim.git
   cd portfolio-sim
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

The application will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

### Your Settings Are Saved

Your inputs are automatically saved to your browser's local storage. This means:
- Your settings will still be there if you close the browser and come back later
- The selected profile (Early Career, Mid-Career, Retirement, or Custom) is preserved
- Your custom profile is saved separately from the built-in profiles
- All supplemental contributions are stored and remembered
- You can try different scenarios without losing your baseline configuration

## Understanding the Results

### Dynamic Display

The results adapt to your settings:
- Loan-related columns are hidden when "Include Loan" is turned off
- Tax-related columns are hidden when "Withhold Taxes" is turned off
- Contribution-related columns are hidden when no supplemental contributions are enabled

### Summary Tab

The summary shows your initial share count, annualized dividend yield, monthly loan payment, and when the loan will be paid off.

### Charts

The charts visualize your portfolio growth in two ways:
- **Until Loan Payoff**: Shows portfolio value, loan principal, and net portfolio value until the loan is paid off
- **Full Amortization**: Shows net portfolio value for the entire amortization period

### Detailed Tables

The amortization schedule provides a detailed breakdown of what happens each month or year:
- How dividends accumulate and are distributed
- Tax implications of dividend income
- Loan payment progress
- New shares acquired through DRIP
- Contributions made during each period
- Overall portfolio valuation

Hover over rows and columns in the table to highlight data and track values more easily.

### Data Export

You can export the amortization data to CSV format for further analysis:
- Click the "Export CSV" button in the top-right corner of the table
- The exported file will reflect the current tab selection (Yearly Summary or Full Detail)
- Only visible columns will be included in the export (based on Loan, Tax, and Contribution settings)
